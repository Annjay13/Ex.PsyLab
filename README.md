# **Experimental Psychology LabPractice**
_________________________________________

Experimental work is hard. Opportunities for suboptimality and failure abound. This course is all about avoiding pitfalls and cultivating a mindset aimed at continually improving practices. We will execute the whole process of implementation, execution and data analysis during this course, based on a replication of an existing experiment, which we will preregister.
